            <h2>About the programmer</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Salah, the developer behind EventEase — a passionate and self-driven programmer with a deep interest in building practical, user-friendly web applications.
                With experience in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, I enjoy turning ideas into real-world solutions. My goal is to create platforms that are not only functional but also intuitive and engaging for users.
                This project was built as a hands-on learning experience, covering everything from user authentication and event management to contact forms and admin functionality.
                Along the way, I gained valuable insights into full-stack development, deployment, and user-centered design.
                Whether you’re a fellow developer, a curious visitor, or a potential collaborator — thank you for stopping by and using EventEase!
